# InterviewTracer
I had this idea because I'm now looking for a job and it's hard to maintain and control the ammount of interviews I have in a month...

After analysis I understood that I was having in between 45 to 60 interviews per month.

These interviews usually come in a 3 Phase behaviour where it goes as:

- 1ยบ Phase: Get to Know the Recruiter, Company that you're recruiting too. Also the Recruiter will learn stuff about the probably next employee. This part is only to know you and for you to know them.
- 2ยบ Phase: Consists on getting to know the project manager to which you will start working on, or getting in contact again with the same recruiter for you to execute any kind of evaluations or tests to challenge your knowledge.
- 3ยบ Phase: This is the last part. Usually you'll get to this Phase only after contact of the project manager or the recruiter or the customer itself that the project is for. From this point is where you will 80% of the times will start to work.
It's also overwhelming because this is the part where if there is someone that as a better curriculum or more time or even if it's only a chosing standoff.

From this perspective what is the idea of this application?

The idea is to have a form of tracing in between various sistems that give you the ability to communicate to companies and send your CV or application. From here the idea is too have a small data base that will retain the information of the Date, Company, in which phase you are on...

App Flow/How it will function

The app through out the time will receive updates on which Apps/Websites/APIs we can connect too cause that only depends if these apps give you the ability to consume data over a login to a REST or SOAP API or Cloud WebService.
From here the Startup will only give you the ability to see which applications you sent (as for example: LinkedIn) and as stated before it will separate that in Phases, information about phases and so on so on... You will also be able to edit that information locally has the idea is to have a copy of the data of the user with the intent of retaining minimal information about the user (Username, Name, password and Email [Email and password will always be hashed])
